# SFrameAnalysis (thanks C.Lange)

Repository using submodules for ntuple-based analysis (at PSI T3).

## Getting started

You need ROOT or CMSSW to get started, here CMSSW will be used, and the installation will be done into a new directory:
```
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
cmsrel CMSSW_8_0_20
cd CMSSW_8_0_20/src
cmsenv
cd ../..
```
Then clone this repository (or your fork of it):
```
source init.sh
```

Setup and compile SFrame:
```
cd SFrame
source setup.sh
make
cd ..
```

## Compilation

To compile all submodules:
```
source make.sh
```
To ```make distclean``` for all submodules:
```
source makedistclean.sh
```
Mind that SFrame itself and any other directory, which is not a submodule, will not be touched.
